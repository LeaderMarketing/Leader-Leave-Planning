## 🚀 Getting Started – Add Busy Periods to Your Outlook Calendar

**First things first!** I recommend importing the busy periods into your Outlook calendar so you always have visibility of critical times.

### How to Import Busy Periods to Outlook:

1. **Go to the Leave Planner:** https://leadermarketing.github.io/Leader-Leave-Planning/
2. **Click "Add to Outlook"** button in the legend panel (top of the page)
3. **A file will download** called `LEADER_Busy_Periods_2026.ics`
4. **Open the downloaded file** – it will automatically open in Outlook
5. **Click "Import"** when Outlook prompts you
6. The busy periods will now appear in your calendar with color-coded categories:
   - 🔴 **Red** = Grand Final periods (June & November) – Avoid leave
   - 🟠 **Orange** = Busy periods – Limit to 2-3 days

This gives you a visual reminder right in your calendar when planning ahead!
